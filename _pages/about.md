I'm a guy who is curious about everything, but mostly all computer stuffs. I graduated computer engineering in 2018. And tried to learn things everyday I can. And every new day I am trying to improve myself to become a good software engineer. I never stop researching and trying the break things.I love break things actually. That makes me learn easier. I Always tried to be open new technologies and work with other people as a team. I joined some kind of small and mid size projects. 
Recently I am working with PHP, MySql and Golang. Also trying to learn devops things in my free times. When I was In university I was using Java and Nodejs for my projects. Now I am trying to improve myself in back-end technologies, software engineering principles, Dev-Ops culture and try to create qualified applications.
