I think it is one of the most useful design pattern. I realized that I've using this pattern very often without knowing it is actually a design pattern. Let's see what [Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Template_method_pattern) defines what Template Method Pattern is:

> "In software engineering, the template method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in a method, called template method, which defers some steps to subclasses."

Whoow... It's too fancy right? I usually don't understand when I read a long sentences like this most of the time.

```php
<?php
  
  class A {
  	public function __construct()
    {
      
    }
}
```
